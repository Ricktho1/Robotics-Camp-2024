Congratulations on still surviving the camp!!

You just need to know some basics about pybullet.

So fasten up your seatbelts as we launch into the universe of controls!

## What'll you learn?
* In **Subpart 1**, we'll talk about basics of control systems and algorithms.
* In **Subpart 2**, we'll talk a simple basic controller namely the PID controller
* In **Subpart 3**, you'll get to know of another controller namely LQR and the difference between the two.
