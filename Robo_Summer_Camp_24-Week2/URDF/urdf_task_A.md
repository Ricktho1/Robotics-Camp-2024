## Build a Simple 2R Robotic Arm (URDF)

This task introduces you to building a basic robotic arm using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). The robot you'll create, called a "2R Planar Robot Arm," features two revolute joints that connect a base to two links.

What You'll Do:

* Understand the Design: A resource link (or image) will show the robot's structure. Look for two circles representing the revolute joints and links with lengths l1 and l2.

* Build with Simple Shapes:  Don't worry about complex 3D models!  Instead, use a text editor to build the robot's URDF description by visualizing it as a combination of simple shapes like boxes and cylinders.

* Leverage Starter Code: A sample starter code for the URDF file is already available in the designated folder. This code provides a basic structure to build upon.

* Focus on Visual Appearance: While URDF can define various robot properties, for now, you'll focus on how it looks.  Add tags like <visual> and <geometry> to define the robot's visual appearance using simple shapes. Don't worry about properties like mass, collision, and inertia yet â€“ these will be covered later.

Deliverable:

A completed URDF file within the designated folder, defining the robot's visual appearance using simple shapes and relevant tags.

Let's build your first robotic arm! This task lays the foundation for further exploration of robot simulation and functionality.
