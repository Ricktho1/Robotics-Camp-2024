## Bonus Task: Build and Visualize a Simple Excavator (URDF)

This task challenges you to build a basic visual representation of an excavator using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF).

### What You'll Do:

* Design with URDF:  Using a text editor, create a URDF file for a virtual excavator.

* Focus on Visuals:  Define the excavator's components (base, arm, digger) using <visual> and <geometry> tags with simple shapes (boxes, cylinders) for appearance.

* Simulation:  
Access the provided online URDF visualizer. 
Upload your completed URDF file to the visualizer.
Utilize the visualizer's functionalities to define joint positions for the arm segments and digger attachment.
Animate the joint movements to observe and record the excavator's basic functionality (arm movement, digger rotation).

### Deliverables:

* URDF File: A complete URDF file in the designated folder, defining the excavator's visual components with simple shapes and relevant tags.
* Video Recording: Record a short video demonstrating both:
The visual representation of the excavator loaded in the online URDF visualizer.
Basic movements of the arm segments and digger rotation using the visualizer's animation features.
