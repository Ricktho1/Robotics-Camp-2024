# Building the Blueprint: URDF and Robot Design
We've explored robot building blocks (links & joints) and their power source (actuators). Now, meet URDF: the robot's blueprint! This format describes a robot's structure (links, joints, connections) and actuators in a way computers understand. Think building a robot in a simulation - URDF lets software grasp the robot's capabilities and simulate its movements.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started creating your own URDF file:
 
* Warm Up with XML: If you're new to coding, a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JblVElt5K0) on basic XML syntax will be helpful.
* URDF 101: Get familiar with the fundamentals of URDF through [this introductory lecture](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/course-lectures/2-2-1-introduction-to-urdf).
* Hands-on Practice: Now it's time to write your own URDF file! [These tutorials will guide you through the process](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Create%20your%20own%20urdf%20file), focusing on the current core structure. Don't worry about making it look fancy yet.
* Decoding the Code: The various tags and attributes in URDF might initially seem complex, especially regarding joint and link placement. [These resources offer detailed explanations](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) to help you decipher the code.
* Additional Resource: You may follow this [ROS wiki tutorials for URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf). Explore the entire page and learn about URDF

_Pro Tip: The "visual" tag defines your robotâ€™s appearance, while the "collision" tag defines how it interacts with its environment. Ensure both tags have the same settings to avoid unexpected behaviour during simulation._

* Debugging Help: Creating URDF files can be tricky, and syntax errors are common. Enter the following in terminal.

        $ sudo apt-get install liburdfdom-tools

Now, you should be able to run a command named 'check_urdf'. Pass the relative path of your urdf file as an attribute to the command:

        $ check_urdf <path to the URDF file>

This will parse the URDF file and tell you exactly which line has an error. If the file is parsed successfully, a summary of the parent and child links will be outputted.

Remember, creating a URDF file takes practice. Don't get discouraged if it takes some time to master! 

Once you've written your URDF file, you can [visualise it using this online tool](https://mymodelrobot.appspot.com/5629499534213120). Simply paste your code and click "Load URDF" to see your robot come to life on the screen! 

We've included a [sample URDF file for an R2D2 robot](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Robotics-Camp-2023/blob/main/Mastering__Pybullet/PART_1/(2)%20Pybullet%20Basic%20Functions/sample.urdf) and a [Python script (visualizer.py)](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/Robotics-Camp-2023/blob/main/Mastering__Pybullet/PART_1/(2)%20Pybullet%20Basic%20Functions/visualizer.py) to visualise any URDF file. Download both files and play around!

*Tip: If they're not in the same folder, update the path to the URDF file in the Python script.*
