# Joints in Robotics
Now that we understand a robot’s fundamental structure let’s delve deeper into the fascinating world of joints! These critical connection points allow robots to move and interact with their environment. There are several key types of joints, each offering unique advantages:

* Revolute (like your elbow): Rotates around one axis, perfect for reaching and grabbing.
* Prismatic (like a drawer): Slides back and forth in a` straight line for precise movements.
* Spherical (like your shoulder): Offers the most freedom, rotating around multiple axes for complex tasks.
* Cylindrical (like your wrist): Combines rotation around one axis with limited sliding along that same axis.

#### Beyond the Basics:

* Fixed Joints: These act like permanent connections between links, providing stability and defining the robot's shape.
* Continuous Joints: Imagine multiple revolute joints working together for rotation in more than one direction.
* Planar Joints: These allow sliding within a single plane, which is helpful for specific applications.
* Floating Joints: While not achievable with a single joint, some robots use combinations to achieve similar freedom of movement (think all directions!).

Understanding these joints is critical to appreciating the incredible capabilities of robots and the diverse tasks they can perform. The specific joints used depend on the robot's design and purpose.

# Actuators in Robotics
We've explored joints and the connection points for movement, but how do robots move those joints? That's where actuators come in! These are the powerhouses of the robot world, converting energy (electrical, hydraulic, etc.) into controlled movement. Here are some common types:


* Electric Motors: These versatile workhorses come in various sizes and configurations, powering many robots.
* Hydraulic actuators: These use pressurised fluid to generate powerful linear or rotary motion, and they are often used in industrial robots for heavy-duty tasks.
* Pneumatic Actuators: Similar to hydraulic systems, they use compressed air for actuation, offering a more straightforward and lighter option for some applications.
