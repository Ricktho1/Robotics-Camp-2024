# Defining the Robot: Movement and Computation
A robot is a machine that transcends simple automation. It combines the ability to compute with the capability of movement. This movement is achieved through a system of links and joints.

* Links are rigid segments that form the robot's body and limbs. They provide structure and define the robot's overall shape.
* Joints are the connection points between links, allowing for controlled movement. Motors or actuators power these joints, enabling the robot to manipulate its environment.

This movement comes from a network of links (rigid segments) connected by joints. Motors control these joints, allowing the robot to interact with its surroundings.

Think of a robot's structure like a chain:

* Base Link: The foundation that anchors the robot.
* Child Links: Connected to the base or other links, they move and connect to form the robot's body.

This blend of movement and computation makes robots versatile, tackling tasks from simple pick-and-place to complex environmental interactions.
