# FINAL TASK
This challenge focuses on designing a simple robotic arm with a gripper end actuator in CAD software, converting the design to URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), and visualizing its movement in RViz, a robot visualization tool.

**Estimated Time: 3 days**

## Challenge Breakdown:

### Design the Robotic Arm:

Use the CAD software (Fusion 360) to design a simple robotic arm with the following features:

* A base for stability.
* An arm with at least two revolute joints to enable movement. (3 Links)
* A gripper end actuator to grasp objects (simple claw or pincer mechanism).

Consider joint ranges of motion and overall functionality.

### Convert to URDF:

Utilize a CAD to URDF add-on (installed previously) to convert your 3D model into a URDF file.

*The URDF file should define the robot's links, joints, and their properties (joint types, axes of rotation, limits) correctly for effective conversion.*

#### Refer to the add-on documentation for detailed instructions.

### Simulate in RViz:

* Install and configure RViz, a robot visualization tool.
* Load the generated URDF file into RViz to create a simulated model of your robotic arm.(CHECK fusion2urdf documentations on steps to run the files) 

Explore RViz functionalities to visualize the arm's structure and define joint positions.
Animate the joint movements to observe the arm's range of motion.

## Deliverables:

* A 3D model of your robotic arm design in your chosen CAD software format (Public Link of the fusion file).
* The corresponding URDF file generated from the CAD model.
* Screenshots or recordings demonstrating the visualization of your robot arm and its joint movements in RViz.

### Tips:
* Start with a simple arm design with a limited number of joints.
* Numerous online resources and tutorials exist for CAD, URDF, and RViz.
* Don't hesitate to experiment and refine your design throughout the challenge.
* Reach out to your seniors any time for help and suggestions

**This challenge provides a fundamental hands-on experience in robotic arm design, simulation, and visualization. By completing it, you'll gain valuable skills for further exploration in the exciting world of robotics!**
