# Introduction to CAD (using Fusion360)

Picture this: you've got a revolutionary robot design in your head, but sketching it out just doesn't do it justice. Enter the fascinating world of Computer-Aided Design (CAD)! It's like a digital sculptor's studio, where engineers can bring robots to life in stunning 3D. Think of it as the blueprint stage, just like how URDF describes a robot's structure in code.Both CAD and URDF are the secret ingredients that turn those initial sparks of robot ideas into real, functional machines!Get ready to explore the magic behind creating these robotic marvels.

## Fusion 360 installation guide

Fusion 360 is a powerful 3D design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software platform. Here are some of its key functionalities:
* 3D Modeling: Create realistic digital models of objects, perfect for designing robots and other complex machines.

* Assembly Simulation: Virtually test how components fit together and move, identifying potential design flaws before building.
* Joint Definition: Define various joint types (revolute, prismatic, etc.) within your model to simulate realistic robot movement.

Fusion 360 is a versatile tool used in various industries, but its intuitive interface and powerful features make it a great choice for aspiring robot designers to bring their creations to life.

For Mac users, you may install ***[Fusion360  directly from its website](https://www.autodesk.in/products/fusion-360/free-trial)*** and run it along side the Virtual Machine.

Good news for Linux users! Autodesk Fusion 360 is available as a Snap package, making it easy to install on popular distributions like Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.

        $ sudo snap install --edge fusion360 --devmode
You might now be able to see the fusion 360 screen, but it asks you to login via web, but is unable to open a prompt on web
Close Fusion 360, Open a new terminal,

        $ fusion_idsdk=false snap run fusion360

Ohh yes! You now will be able to see the Login Screen!

**If the above does not work you may download Fusion360 from it's website in the Windows OS** (link provided above)
