# Converting from CAD to URDF

Designing robots in CAD software is intuitive, but converting those models to robot code (URDF) can be tedious.Luckily, CAD to URDF add-ons simplify this process.

These tools translate your CAD model's geometry, joints, and connections into URDF format, making it easier for robots to understand in simulations. With less time spent coding, you can focus on refining your robot design.

While CAD to URDF add-ons offer a powerful and convenient solution, it's crucial to carefully review the documentation provided in the GitHub repository. Each add-on may have specific requirements or functionalities. Taking the time to understand these details will ensure you use the add-on effectively and generate accurate URDF files for your robot design.
