Have you ever dreamt of building a robot? Maybe one that can pick up objects or complete simple tasks? This challenge is your gateway to making that dream a reality â€“ virtually, at least!

 Here, we'll guide you through designing, simulating, and visualizing the robots.


This journey will take you through three key stages:

* **Design:** We'll introduce you to using CAD software to create a 3D model of your robotic arm. You'll learn about its basic components like the base, arm segments, joints, and gripper.
* **URDF Conversion:** Ever heard of a robot speaking its own language? Well, URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is kind of like that. We'll show you how to convert your beautiful 3D model into a URDF file, essentially giving your robot a digital description.
* **Simulation:** Ready to see your creation come to life? RViz is a robot visualization tool that lets you bring your URDF file to life. You'll be able to manipulate your robot arm virtually and observe its movements.

This challenge is designed for beginners, so no prior experience with robotics is necessary.  We'll provide all the necessary resources and guidance along the way.  So, are you ready to take your first steps into the exciting world of robot design? Let's get started!
